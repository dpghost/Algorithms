 # Algorithms
 
  This is a partial respository with a few stand-alone apps and a few soltion files. 
  As a first attempt to create a repository, I managed to upload a few of the needed files  needed to comprise  complete a single resposity.  These files, however, are intended for educational reference alone 
  As such, they are provided "as is". they are written in C#, a language designed for type safety.
  They scale well in the .NET Framework, but   I am not sure how files like this would work on a mono IDE.
  It is very likely one could get the good results in a responsive and rapid manner. 
  If there are any  missing parts to an attempted whole, then I will end up hearing about and try to rectify it.
  
  Many thanks to Git Hub.
